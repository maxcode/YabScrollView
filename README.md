##Description

Everybody loves iOS, so we, the Android Team at Maxcode created YabScrollView! 
As the name suggests, it's Yet Another Bouncing Scroll View imitating the bouncing effect from iOS!
Forget the boring Android default effect for reaching the end of your ScrollView! 
We also added a listener for swiping up and down when the ScrollView already reached the end and you
do another swipe in that direction.

## Motivation

At the moment there isn't a reliable component that behaves well on older platforms and also 
supports the swipe listener we needed, so we took the matter in our hands! 

## How to use

Check the sample module. More details to be added :).
